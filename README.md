Hey there! This is my **first-ever mobile app** built using **Expo**. I was tired of losing paper receipts and having no idea where my money went at the end of the month, so I decided to build a solution for it.
It’s a handy little tool that turns your messy pile of receipts into a clean, digital financial overview.

## 📋 Project Overview
This project represents my debut in mobile development using the **Expo** ecosystem. The goal is to solve the friction of manual expense logging by automating data entry through machine learning and providing high-level financial oversight for everyday users.

## 🚀 Core Functionalities

### 🔍 Intelligent Data Extraction
* **Smart OCR Scanning:** Automated extraction of merchant metadata, transaction dates, and totals using high-precision Optical Recognition.
* **Warranty Tracking:** Includes a customizable warranty timer. Set specific periods for your purchases and receive notifications before they expire.
* **Multi-Currency Support:** Global financial compatibility with automated exchange rate conversion for international transactions.

### 👥 Social Spending & Splitting
* **Split Bill Functionality:** Easily divide costs from a single receipt across multiple people.
* **Frequent Contacts:** Save and manage a list of "frequent splitters" to quickly assign shares to friends or roommates without re-entering data.

### 📊 Financial Intelligence
* **Automated Categorization:** Smart classification of transactions into logical sectors (e.g., Logistics, Subsistence, Utilities) to enhance fiscal clarity.
* **Analytical Dashboards:** Real-time visualization of spending patterns and budget variance analysis to drive informed financial decisions.

### 📂 Compliance & Reporting
* **Secure Digital Archive:** An encrypted repository for digital receipt storage, ensuring audit-readiness and easy warranty retrieval.
* **Professional Exporting:** Generation of industry-standard PDF and CSV reports, optimized for tax compliance or reimbursement workflows.

## 🛠 Technical Implementation

* **Framework:** React Native via Expo SDK
* **State Management:** React Context API
* **Database:** MySQL
* **Image Processing:** Currently under trial and error (exploring Expo Camera & Cloud Vision)
* **Status:** 🚧 Ongoing development and architectural refinement.
